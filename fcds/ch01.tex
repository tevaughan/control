\begin{problem}
   What are the main components of a feedback control system?
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
   A feedback control system has
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item a \emph{sensor} that measures the output that is to be controlled,
      \item an \emph{input filter} that provides a reference value against
         which the sensor's output is compared,
      \item a \emph{comparator} that computes the difference between the output
         of the sensor and the output of the input filter,
      \item a \emph{controller} that translates the output of the comparator
         into a control signal,
      \item a \emph{plant}, which consists of
         \begin{enumerate}
            \item an \emph{actuator} that receives the control signal and
               causes a physical change in the system and
            \item a \emph{process} that can be disturbed by environmental
               forces but is primarily influenced by the actuator to produce an
               output measured by the sensor.
         \end{enumerate}
   \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}
